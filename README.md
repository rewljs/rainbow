# @rewl/rainbow

True Color display in terminal with no fallback.

## Features

- No dependencies.
- Carefully chosen fancy colors.
- Type linting.
- Well tested. *(probably)*
- Full in-file API documents with JSDoc.

## Caveats

- No detection on color support of console and no fallback.
- Performance is not optimized. If you care about it, consider using more lightweight library like [kleur](https://github.com/lukeed/kleur).
- Although `Node.js`-related module is not used, this library is mostly meant for terminal and does not test against consoles in web browsers.

## Showcase

This result is generated by [`show.js`](./show.js) file.

## Usage

```js
import r = require('@rewl/rainbow')

console.log(r.blue('Blue text'))

console.log(r.orange().bg.dark.blue('Orange text with dark blue background'))

console.log(r.u().rainbow('Rainbow text with underline color'))
```

## Chainable Methods

**Styles**, **Colors** and **Modifiers** are chainable.

**Styles** and **Colors** are functions and should always be called, whereas **Modifiers** are getters.

**Styles** and **Colors** called with no arguments continues the options chain, and calling them with the string would finish the chaining and return the rendered content.

**Modifiers** are getters and cannot be called as function. Using them would always continue the chaining.

### Styles

These styles are supported:

```
bold (b), italic (i), underline (u), strikethrough (s)
dim, blink, inverse, hidden, reset
```

Styles can be nested.

```js
// The word 'italic' would be both underlined and italic.
console.log(r.u(`underlined ${r.i('italic')} text`))
```

Notably, `reset` would only reset the styles **inside** it.

```js
console.log(r.red(`Red text but ${r.reset('these texts are reset')} and these are not.`))
```

### Colors

These colors are presetted:

#### Color group
```
red, orange, honey, yellow, lemon, olive, green, mint,
cyan, sky, blue, purple, violet, magenta, pink, brown
```

#### Grayscale group
```
black, gray / grey (*1), white
v0, v10, v20, ..., v100 (*2)
```

**\*1** Both spellings are okay.

**\*2** `v` represents `value`, and those are colors where hue and saturation are 0 and value is as in their name. To be specific, `v0` = `black`, `v50` = `gray` and `v100` = `white`

Commonly used terminal color names are covered.

Like styles, colors can also be nested, and the color of the same field (text or background) would be overrided.

```js
// The word 'yellow' would have both yellow color and violet background.
console.log(r.bg.violet(`Violet background with ${r.yellow('yellow')} text inside`))

// The word 'blue' would be overrided to blue.
console.log(r.red(`Red text with ${r.blue('blue')} text inside`))
```

### Modifiers

There are currently three modifiers, **bg**, **dark** and **light**.

**bg** is to modify where the color should apply.

**dark** and **light** is to decide which color sets are used for next color call.

After a **Color** method is called, the state of all modifiers would be reset, and should be chained again if they are to be applied to next color call.

#### bg

`bg` modifier would make the next color method to be applied to background.

```js
console.log(r.bg.red('Text with red background'))
```

#### dark

`dark` midifier would make the next color method applies dark color (as shown in [showcase](#showcase)).

If a color does not have a dark version (e.g. `black` and `white`), it would fallback to its default color.

It differs from `dim` that `dark` colors are chosen by hand.

```js
console.log(r.dark.blue('Text with dark blue color'))
```

#### light

`dark` midifier would make the next color method applies light color (as shown in [showcase](#showcase)).

If a color does not have a light version (e.g. `black` and `white`), it would fallback to its default color.

```js
console.log(r.light.pink('Text with light pink color'))
```
